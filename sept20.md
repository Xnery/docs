go here to join the tf2 server -> https://shounic.github.io/docs/100tf2

on the 100 player server, we stopped experimenting with server performance settings once we got to a stable and good enough point. 

but the next video i'm making is about all the stuff we did since the last video i made about the 100 player server a month ago, and for that i need to go revisit the settings we picked. today i'm messing with them to confidently conclude what does what, get a better idea of exactly how much they change things, and also to get a sense of where certain limits lie, etc. you get the point.

also i don't want to fill my hard drive with a 7 hour video recording so i'm turning off the cat pngtuber thing in the bottom right, in case i need to go back to use footage from the stream.
